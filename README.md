# CS50 Problem Solutions

Welcome to the repository for solutions to CS50 problems! This repository contains my implementations of problem sets and projects from Harvard University's [CS50: Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/).

## About

CS50 is a rigorous and hands-on introduction to computer science. It covers foundational concepts including:
- Algorithms
- Data structures
- Memory management
- Web development
- Problem-solving techniques

This repository includes my solutions to the following problem sets:

- Problem Set 1: C Basics
- Problem Set 2: Arrays and Strings
- Problem Set 3: Algorithms
- Problem Set 4: Memory
- Problem Set 5: Data Structures
- Problem Set 6: Python
- Problem Set 7: SQL and Flask
- Final Project: [Recipe Recommendation and Shopping List Generator]

## Disclaimer

The solutions in this repository are my own and are provided for learning and reference purposes only. If you are currently taking CS50, I encourage you to attempt the problems on your own before referring to these solutions.
